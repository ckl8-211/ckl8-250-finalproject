            This application will take a picture of your TaiChi pose using voice input. To
            begin, please set the wait time before the picture will be taken. Then
            perform your TaiChi move while calling out the name of the move you are doing.
            You move should be completed at the same time when you finish calling out the name.
            A picture will then be taken and saved for later analysis.
            Note: You must mount and locate your camera to take a full body pose.
